# Remember.place
The history of neighborhood change is preserved in only bits and scraps of memories – hidden in obscure archives and distributed across online forums. Remember.place is an experiment aimed at collecting these histories in one place, creating a hyper-focused database of localized memories.

The project creates a front-end face for interactions with a WordPress database, using Advanced Custom Fields. It iterates on an earlier project ("Radical Mapper") and was developed as part of my Fulbright research at the University of Strathclyde. Ultimately, I didn't carry development forward. I love the idea, but the execution was pretty clunky. If readdressed, I'd preserve a lot of the PHP-based core functionality and simplify the UI a great deal. That said, there's much leaner ways of doing this than building on top of WP.
