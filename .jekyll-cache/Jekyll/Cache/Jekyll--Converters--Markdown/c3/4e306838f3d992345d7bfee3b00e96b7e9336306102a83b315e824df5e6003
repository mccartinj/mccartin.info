<p>A fair housing plan for the Town of Arlington, MA, an inner core suburb close to Cambridge and Downtown Boston. This plan meets the requirements of a federal â€œAnalysis of Impediments to Fair Housing,â€ but it has the spirit of an â€œAssessment of Fair Housingâ€ under AFFH regulations. I was involved with the project as an analyst from the start, and took over project management at the projectâ€™s end. MAPC worked with the Lawyersâ€™ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law to develop the plan.</p>
